In Kato, conversations are called *rooms*. All room histories are archived and searchable. There are a few different kinds:

*Unrestricted rooms* are where most time is spent in Kato. **Anyone in your organization** can follow, read, and write to unrestricted rooms. Some teams have a single unrestricted room for all discussion; others create an unrestricted room for each major discussion area. Whatever works for your team is fine.

Access to *Restricted rooms* is limited to **specific people**. Admins in your organization can grant and revoke access to restricted rooms. If the current room is restricted, a red bar in the sidebar shows who has access to it.

**Note:** Creating a restricted room **doesn't automatically give you access to it**. Sometimes admins create restricted rooms on behalf of others. (For example, an administrative assistant might create a room where sensitive financial details are discussed.)

For more info on restricted rooms, see [Restricted Rooms](introducing-restricted-rooms) and [Changing Room Access](introducing-changing-room-access).

*1:1 (one-to-one) rooms* are **private conversations** between two people. Only you and the other person can read messages in your mutual 1:1 room. To open a 1:1 room, just click the person's name in the Kato sidebar.

**Note:** Admins can disable 1:1 rooms for an organization, in the Policy settings for that organization.

### ![icon_support](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/81bb199e41a8e4729cd4e1354aa2af9a611c2534a46be563149eda97cfb61954/clip.png) Kato Support Rooms

Your *Kato support room* is special—it gives your team **direct access to Kato staff**, who are usually available to answer any questions and discuss suggestions. There's one Kato support room per organization.

**Note:** Admins can disable Support rooms for an organization, in the Policy settings for that organization. Anyone can hide Support rooms for himself in Account settings.

### ![icon_audit](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/1ff1ab2420539f3d4d5b008f957e047bac4f06c45c9d08ebd288dc34975a965b/clip.png) Security Audit Logs

*Security Audit Log* rooms aren't really a separate type. They just have a special icon, showing that they use the [*Audit Log* integration](https://kato.im/articles/introducing-security-audit-log/). This posts certain automatic messages to the room. Otherwise, these are just normal (restricted or unrestricted) rooms.

### ![icon_public](https://s3.amazonaws.com/kato-share/b2695440ca4e074b7b4c5d4a434e7772615146e4221c3b0401f4eb6f72f1709/Untitled%208.png) Public Rooms

*Public rooms* have a URL that you can share with anyone, to let them chat with your team. They allow you to interact with your audience just like we interact with you in your Kato support room. (For now, we've removed this feature while we work out some technical issues, but we plan to bring it back.)
